# Chocobo World

![Title Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/przem360/Chocobo-World/master/artworks/title_screen.png)


A (very) simple mini-game for [ArduBoy](https://www.arduboy.com/) based on a ChocoboWorld minigame for [PocketStation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PocketStation).
  
Warning! Game may be (probably is) buggy as heck.


## How to play

- Explore the world with D-Pad
- Press B to open the map
- Dots on a map are events, events are battles
- Win every battle (in batle mode press B when cursor is in the middle of a line to hit your oponent)
- Win boss battle
- Find Mog

## TODO


 - Animations for battle mode
 - Chocobo should do something when player is not active
 - Other type of events?
